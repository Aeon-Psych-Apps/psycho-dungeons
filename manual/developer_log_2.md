🧱 Dev Log #2 for My You Did What?! With Tines Fall 2025 Project - Map stuff, UI, and first playable bits! (Building an RPG Dungeon Crawler fully within Tines Automation)\r\n\r\nPicking up where Dev Log #1 left off. This week I focused on getting the game world to look and behave like an actual game instead of a design doc. Short version: the map is alive and the player can start moving through it. Screenshots incoming in this thread.\r\n\r\nWhat I built\r\n • Character select scene UI is in. Players can pick a character and jump straight into the world.\r\n • Placeholder Town map UI added so there is a non-dungeon hub for shops and saves.\r\n • First rendering of the dungeon map grid. It actually looks like a dungeon now.\r\n • Dungeon rooms are generated dynamically. No more hand placing every tile.\r\n • Worked on integrating images and graphics into the dungeon map using the uploader tool I mentioned earlier. That made iterating art much faster.\r\n • Preliminary pathing works. Player movement and basic path checks are functional.\r\n • Dungeon interact and exit workflow building. Triggers for room events and leaving a dungeon are now wired up.\r\n • Revamped dungeon map graphics for clearer tile types and better readability in Pages.\r\nNotes and gotchas\r\n • Generating rooms dynamically inside Tines Resources was surprisingly fiddly but doable. I leaned on structured JSON resource objects to keep map state consistent.\r\n • The image uploader saved a ton of manual patching. If you are testing visual features inside Tines Pages, invest time in tooling to import assets faster. You will thank yourself.\r\n • Pathing is still basic. It prevents obvious nonsense, but I need to harden edge cases like multi-room pathfinding and blocked tiles.\r\n\r\nThis project might be over my head! 🥵
