🧱 Dev Log #3 - Combat, accounts, and prettier dungeons\r\n\r\nProgress log 3 for my You Did What?! With Tines Fall 2025 automation project. Short version: Dynamic path generation and room events added, icons animate, combat UI exists, accounts actually work, and I added a new class that wants to stab things quietly 🏹 \r\n\r\nProgress in sequence:\r\n• Tested more of the room generation and pathing systems, and added dynamic icon animation rendering so the map feels alive.\r\n• Implemented an early battle UI and battle turn sequencing. You can now start an encounter and watch turns resolve.\r\n• Captured a screenshot of the full Tines storyboard so you can see how the whole flow wires together across Pages and Actions\r\n• Upgraded dungeon graphics to look more dungeon like and added more animations for ambience and clarity.\r\n• Updated character select and creation UI so new accounts can be created without needing manual invites or approvals.\r\n• Added account creation confirmation via email. The flow is abstracted enough to be text or SMS compatible with small tweaks.\r\n• Revamped the account login page to reflect the new create/confirm process and reduce friction for testing.\r\n• Added a new Archer class, which will probably be renamed Rogue later but for now likes bows and opportunistic sneakery.\r\n\r\nNotes and lessons\r\n • Turn sequencing inside Tines felt weird at first because Tines is not a game loop engine. The trick I used was to model turns as discrete events and persist state between them via Resources and use page loop redirects to update UI.\r\n • The storyboard screenshot is useful for anyone who wants to understand how Pages, Resources, and Actions are orchestrated.\r\n • Account confirmations add a lot of testing overhead but pay off with fewer ghost testers and easier cross-tenant imports. (also reduces spam accounts)\r\n\r\n\r\nHoping to get the gear/loot system implemented, discord/slack account integrations, and polish out the animation/graphics before submissions close this week!
