🧱 Dev Log #1 - Building the foundation\r\n\r\nFollowing up on yesterday’s announcement post for my YouDidWhat?! With Tines Fall 2025 project, here’s a look at the early stages of development.\r\n\r\nQuick project recap:\r\n A fully Tines contained RPG roguelike dungeon crawler game with account linking, a web browser UI, dynamically generated dungeon maps, loot and gear tables, inventory management, and turn-based combat.\r\nIf time allows, I’ll add Discord and Slack integrations and maybe even a “game patch” system that can update the game after it’s been imported into other Tines tenants.\r\n\r\nThe idea follows my motto with working in Tines: What can I do within Tines, or how can I abuse Tines? With this, I decided to see if a fully playable game could exist using only Tines and its own APIs, so no external servers or external integrations for processing/data.\r\n\r\nEarly development progress:\r\n The proof of concept works. Now the focus has been wiring logic and resource handling to make the game actually playable inside Tines.\r\nSome of the first major pieces:\r\n • Player data and game config data store and retrieve directly through Tines Resources. Getting this setup was one of the biggest pieces of foundation to making this project work within my goals.\r\n • Early UI setup for login and character selection screens using Tines Pages (first time going this deep into Tines Pages)\r\n • Built a small side tool for uploading and importing graphics faster, which already saves me hours of image importing\r\n • Title page now supports account creation and save/resume functionality, and it’s already structured for Discord, Slack, and web cross-play... Just need to build the UIs
