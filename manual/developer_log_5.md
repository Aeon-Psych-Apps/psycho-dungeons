Project Reflection\n\nNo real dev log to provide this time, and likely won't have many structured updates going forward until project submission. Kinda been all over the place this weekend and in dev grind mode when not 😅\n\nSo this post is more of a reflection at the current point in time 🙂\n\nDefinitely exhausted my brain working on this project but also super excited for the way it has panned out. I really wanted to put my Tines skills to the test and push my limits, and I strongly believe I accomplished that in the 14 days I spent developing.\n\nThere are so many cool features and tools I was able to use, implement, and discover. I'm even thinking about recording a developer's commentary walkthrough video at some point.\n\nTop 3 Favorite Features (in no particular order)\n1. Formulas for Hiding/Disabling/Default-Valuing Page Elements\n\nThis made the UI/game feel far more interactive in certain areas — especially since I’m basically faking the animated portions.\n\n2. Prompt() Formula\n\nAllowed me to build a slick real-time account invite/verification process.\nOriginally, I didn’t include verification for new accounts, but I realized that was asking for trouble with spam creation.\n\n3. Versatility of Tines Pages\n\nI had never really explored Tines Pages before this project, but I love all the features: redirect, move to next, auto-submit, etc.\nCombined with the formulas above, I was able to create simulated animations by swapping image references on page load with custom redirect modes.\n\nNext Steps\n\nI’ll probably remove the Discord/Slack integration in favor of polishing menus, graphics, and implementing the game patch service.\nWhile the integrations would be cool, they don’t add much value compared to the versatility of Tines Pages for the UI.\n\nWe’ll just have to see how much time I have left.
