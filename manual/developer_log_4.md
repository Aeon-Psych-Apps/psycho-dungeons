🧱 Dev Log #4 Loot, UI updates , and the circle of life 🧬 \r\n\r\nRecap: Continuation of developer log updates from the RPG Dungeon Crawler game I am building fully within Tines automation platform for their \"You Did What?! With Tines\" Fall 2025 community competition.\r\n\r\nThis one’s a bit of a catch-up post since I’m away from my main build (which has my dev log and images), but the new screenshots are from the current version.\r\n\r\nThe biggest updates since log 3 revolve around making the game actually feel like a roguelike: player's characters can become fatally wounded now (even perma'd), and items are finally starting to matter!\r\n\r\nWhat’s new\r\n • Character fatal wound system is live. A player's character can actually hit 0 health now instead of being immortal.\r\n • Built framework for elixir \"exlixer\" 🤣 consumables for revival. Once fully integrated, If you have one, you’re back on your feet. If not… your character is permanently gone.\r\n • Began implementing the loot generator and loot pools. Drops now pull from structured tables, which gives more flexibility for item rarity and scaling. Have material/quality bonuses, rarity bonuses, and even a rare signature named item bonus for stats and gear value.\r\n • With loot in place, I revamped how gear and inventory are handled inside the player save object resource and updated the Town UI to better show character status.\r\n\r\nComing along great! Just need to finish implementing the actual \"Shop\" mechanics, tweak enemy/dungeon event drop rates for loot to complete the \"core\" gameplay experience. Since it seems the deadline for project submissions has been extended till at least Monday 10/27, I will also be attempting to still integrate Slack/Discord cross/play UIs as well as polishing up the animations/graphics over the weekend
