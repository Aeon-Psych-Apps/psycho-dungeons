Developer Commentary: Building an RPG Dungeon Crawler Entirely in Tines\n\nWhen I started this project, I wanted to see how far I could push both my own skills and the Tines automation platform itself. The result? A fully functional RPG Dungeon Crawler, built and served entirely within Tines. No external backend. No fancy frontend framework. Just pure creativity and a lot of formula work.\n\nThis wasn’t just a technical challenge; it was a personal one. I set out to answer a simple question: how far can automation logic be stretched before it becomes a game engine?\n\nConcept and Motivation\n\nThe goal was simple in words but ambitious in scope:\nBuild a playable dungeon crawler experience completely powered by Tines.\n\nEvery map, every encounter, every stat and loot calculation was driven through Tines Pages and Story actions, using combinations of formulas, loops, and prompts to try and mimic real-time interactivity and animation.\n\nI wanted to blur the line between automation and entertainment, using the same platform designed for workflows and incident response to host a fully dynamic game world.\n\nKey Systems and Features\nThe Login and Account System\n\nThis part became a personal favorite.\nI built a real-time login flow using the PROMPT() formula to handle account verification and invites. It’s interactive, and fits neatly into the overall UX without technically relying on any external authentication system.\n\nDynamic Pages and UI Logic\n\nPages became the backbone of the game. Using hide, disable, and default value formulas, I made the interface react dynamically to the player’s state. Combined with looping page redirects, these features simulate turn-based gameplay and animation-like transitions.\n\nIt’s wild how fluid it feels once you forget you’re technically just refreshing forms through automation logic.\n\nProcedural Dungeons, Loot, and Stats\n\nThe procedural generation system became one of the hardest but most rewarding parts.\nTines now builds random dungeon maps, spawns loot dynamically, and scales enemy stats based on player progression. Balancing the damage formulas and ensuring fairness was tough, but watching it all come together felt surreal.\n\nThe Patch System\n\nA late addition and one I’m particularly proud of. Did not have time to fully test it, but seems like it works as planned...\nIt (in theory) acts like a live update mechanism, letting me push updates and content changes even to other game installations on other Tines tenants. Whether it fully holds up under stress remains to be seen, but it’s a clever nod to real-world software versioning within a no-code framework. Biggest 2 downfalls I currently see with it is it basically locks the hosting server to always have the URL live (not sure if there is a way to dynamically change it after product ships), as well as potentially could see rate limits hitting if for some reason the game gets a lot of attention.\n\nLessons and Challenges\n\nThis project demanded I wear every hat imaginable: designer, developer, system architect, tester, and artist. All in just 14 days.\nThe dungeon maps, stat scaling, and loot management systems were real brain-benders, but they forced me to think creatively about data flow and recursion within a platform not designed for this kind of logic.\n\nThe real lesson is that limitations breed innovation.\nWorking inside a constrained system like Tines made me more aware of why certain features exist and how they can be bent to serve entirely new purposes.\n\nReflection and Takeaway\n\nLooking back, I’m genuinely proud. Not just that the project works, but that it kinda does feel like a game.\nIt’s a weird and wonderful proof of concept that automation can entertain, not just orchestrate.\n\nNo prior experience with many of these functions. No safety net. Just curiosity, caffeine, and a 14-day deadline.\n\n\nAs this project is being submitted to the You Did What?! With Tines Fall 2025 Community Competition, I appreciate everyone that gives it a chance! At the very least, maybe learn some cool new things that Tines can do! -Tyler Wong, Tines with Tyler
